# HiBy R1 Community Enhancement Patch

A community-maintained collection of discoveries, patches, and firmware enhancements for the HiBy R1.

---

## Overview

This project documents community-discovered methods for unlocking hidden functionality already present within the HiBy R1 firmware.

The objective is to provide a reproducible patching process that can be applied to future firmware releases without redistributing proprietary firmware images.

# Features

## USB DAC Mode Unlock

The HiBy R1 firmware contains dormant USB DAC functionality that can be enabled through configuration changes.

### Enabled Options

* USB Storage Mode
* USB DAC Mode

### Required Changes

### `/usr/resource/config.json`

```json
"dac_to_store": 1
```

### `/usr/resource/set_functions.json`

```json
{"usb_mode":1},
{"dac_feedback":1}
```

### `/usr/resource/midi_set_functions.json`

```json
{"usb_mode":1},
{"dac_feedbak":1}
```

---

## Car Mode Unlock

Enables the hidden Car Mode menu.

### Required Changes

### `/usr/resource/set_functions.json`

```json
{"car_mode":1}
```

### `/usr/resource/midi_set_functions.json`

```json
{"car_mode":1}
```

---

## About Menu Unlock

Enables hidden About/System Information menu entries where supported by the firmware.

## Parametric Equalizer (PEQ) Enablement

Investigation of HiBy firmware versions revealed that the complete Parametric Equalizer framework already exists within the firmware resources.

The stock 1.6 firmware contains:

* PEQ UI layouts
* PEQ dialogs
* PEQ configuration framework

However, the bundled audio engine does not fully expose the functionality.

Replacing the stock 1.6 `hiby_player` with the firmware 1.7 Beta `hiby_player` enables full PEQ functionality.

### Required Files From 1.7 Beta

```text
/usr/bin/hiby_player
/usr/resource/eq.ini
/usr/resource/str/*/eq.ini
```

### Enabled Functionality

* PEQ Combined
* Multi-band Parametric EQ
* Filter Type Selection
* Frequency Adjustment
* Gain Adjustment
* Q-Factor Adjustment
* Preset Save / Recall

---

# Recommended Firmware Configuration

The currently recommended firmware combination is:

```text
HiBy R1 1.6 Mod
+
HiBy R1 1.7 Beta hiby_player
+
HiBy R1 1.7 Beta EQ Resources
```

This configuration provides:

| Feature              | Status |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| Volume Unlock        | ✅      |
| Native DSD           | ✅      |
| Internet Radio       | ✅      |
| SBC XQ Bluetooth     | ✅      |
| USB DAC Mode         | ✅      |
| Standby Menu         | ✅      |
| Car Mode             | ✅      |
| About Menu           | ✅      |
| PEQ Combined         | ✅      |
| Parametric EQ        | ✅      |
| Sorting Improvements | ✅      |

# Future Patch Framework

Suggested repository structure:

```text
patches/
├── 001_usb_dac.py
├── 002_car_mode.py
├── 003_about_menu.py
├── 004_peq_enable.py
├── manifest.json
└── apply_patch.py
```

Example:

```bash
python3 apply_patch.py \
  --firmware r1_1.8.upt \
  --enable-usbdac \
  --enable-peq
```

Output:

```text
r1_1.8_community_patched.upt
```
