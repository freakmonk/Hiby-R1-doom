# Bidhata Launcher -- the bouncer at the HiBy R1's front door.
# S92_03_start_music_player runs THIS instead of hiby_player.sh. We show the

# chaos you've config'd up) once you pick something.
#
# Rootfs is read-only squashfs (the "you can't sit with us" filesystem), so
# we use a flag file on the writable /usr/data to control behaviour:
#
#   /usr/data/bidhata_boot_mode  = "player"  -> skip menu, boot straight to player
#   anything else / absent                   -> show launcher (hello, gorgeous)
#
# bidhata-toggle.sh writes that flag. It's basically a light switch for boot.
